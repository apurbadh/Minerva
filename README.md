## Inspiration
Education is a necessity and an intergral core of our life, which needs to be attainable by everyone, anywhere.  We ourselves, during our childhood, had no access to facilities such as this. We lacked the oppportunity to get services like this and make our learning experience easier and better. As such, we were inspired to create a platform where anyone can access the courses they require. What we couldn't get for ourselves, we wish to provide to others.
